A light JavaScript library to create integrated 2D/3D maps. 

* **2D/3D**: Integrated 2D/3D maps.
* **Open and pluggable**: Easy to extend with techs you may love as [plugins](https://maptalks.org/plugins.html).
* **Performant**: Can smoothly render tens of thousands of geometries.
* **Simple**: Extremely easy to learn and use.
* **Feature Packed**: Essential features for most mapping needs.

## The Story

maptalks.js was born in 2013, for a map-centric project to help [YUM! China](http://www.yumchina.com/en/) to choose locations of KFC and PizzaHut restaurants. After verified in many projects of government depts and enterprises, we did a complete rewrite with ES2015 and open sourced it, hoping it can make your life easier in mapping projects.

## Supported Enviroments

* Modern browsers and IE9+ (only IE11 for 3D features)
* Mobile browsers
* Node >= 4.x
* Electron

maptalks.js is well tested against IE10, IE11, Firefox and Chrome by around 1.5K test cases running on CI services. IE9 is not covered by CI because testing continues to crash for some unknown reasons. Issues on IE9 will be taken care of case by case.
